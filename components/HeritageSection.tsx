                Po:ro Apong is made by women, and it has always been so.
                Knowledge is passed through apprenticeship, not instruction.
                Girls grow up assisting long before they are trusted to decide.
                Years are spent observing, repeating, correcting, and waiting.

                The role of the brewmaster is earned through time, judgment,
                and restraint. What exists is a lineage &mdash; a continuous
                chain of women who carry the responsibility of brewing the
                Po:ro Apong, season after season.

                time, but by keeping it human.
