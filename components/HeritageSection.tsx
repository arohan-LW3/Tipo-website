              Po:ro Apong is made by women, and it has always been so. Knowledge
              is passed through apprenticeship, not instruction. Girls grow up
              assisting long before they are trusted to decide. Years are spent
              observing, repeating, correcting, and waiting.

              Authority is not granted; it is recognized. The role of the
              brewmaster is earned through time, judgment, and restraint. What
              exists is a lineage — a continuous chain of women who carry the
              responsibility of brewing the Po:ro Apong, season after season.

              This structure has preserved the craft not by freezing it in time,
              but by keeping it human.
